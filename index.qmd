# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Environmental Data Science*! This online book serves as your home for all **course readings, tutorials, and foundational materials** that will support our work together this semester. Think of it as a reference library, a warm-up space, and a place to build comfort with ideas before you walk into our classroom or coding lab.

The actual coding assignments, project work will take place through **Posit Cloud**, where we will write and run R code together in a shared, reproducible environment. You will submit your assignment through **Brightspace**. In contrast, this book provides the context, conceptual introductions, and short primers that help you arrive ready to engage, experiment, and collaborate.

Environmental data are messy, interconnected, and deeply tied to the complexity of the systems we care about. Making sense of those data requires both technical skills and reflective habits of mind. Throughout the readings here, you will be introduced to the **vocabulary, patterns of thinking, and approaches** that we will practice together in class—ideas like writing pseudocode, understanding tidy workflows, considering ethical dimensions of environmental data, and recognizing the role of collaboration and iteration in scientific coding. These materials are intentionally concise and geared toward building both confidence and curiosity.

Our course is structured around **authentic learning**, **risk-taking**, and **feedback loops**, rather than performance or perfection. The ungrading philosophy that guides the course means you will engage with this material to learn, not to earn points. Mistakes are expected, revision is encouraged, and progress is measured by how your skills grow across the semester. This book is part of that scaffolding: a space where you can explore concepts at your own pace before applying them in code.

Finally, this book is designed to support the **learning community** we build together—one grounded in respect, collaboration, and shared problem-solving. Your preparation here enables us to make the most of our time in class, where you’ll work with peers, ask questions, and apply ideas using real environmental datasets.

Use these chapters flexibly: read them in order and revisit them as needed. I’m glad you’re here, and I look forward to the work, creativity, and discovery we’ll share this semester.

—Dr. Joel Singley
